# Sets in Python


- One of the 4 builtin data types used to collections of data
- Set properties:
    + \alert{unordered} set items can appear in different order every time you use them
    + \alert{unchangeable} Once a set is created we cannot change the items in it
    + \alert{no duplicates} Sets cannot have 2 items with the same value
    + \alert{not indexed} Set items cannot be referred using index
- A set can store items of the same type as well as different types
